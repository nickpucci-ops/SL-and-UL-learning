# SL-and-UL-learning
CS465 Assignment 2  
Part 1: Choose a parametric supervised training method that predicts the values in z given the attributes in x and y.  Train your learner using python skikit-learn or matlab.  Be careful not to overfit  
There exists a nonlinear relationship between input attributes x and y and output target z.  The training set consists of 50 noisy samples.  You can assume the range of x is -100:100 and the range of y is -100:100  
  
Part 2: Files hw2-Part2-datasetA and hw2-Part2-datasetB contain a two-attribute dataset.  Both sets contain the same number of clusters and the same centroids (with different covariances).  Use an unsupervised learning method (fit gaussians or K-means) to identify the number and parameters of clusters of similar data.  You are to provide the mean and covariance of clusters of similar data or divide the data points into similar sets.  In addition, provide the details of your unsupervised learning method discussing the choice of method and number of clusters.  You can provide empirical information on your search for the number of clusters and the parameters.

Graduate students must fit gaussians to the dataset, not K-means.
